%{
Specifically for project 2, the processing engine must be able to automatically identify the number, 
positions (pixel coords), shapes, and colors of spots on the game board.

Specifically for the demo we are required to have a game state structure
and various outputs.
The struct should contain:
Color and location of each identified colored sticker (space)
Location (pixel coords) of the centroid of each identified space
Images used for analysis:
- Original (background) Image
- Current image
- Differential Image
- Difference after noise removal and enhancement of foreground objects
- Additional outputs from processing
